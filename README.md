 Herein I impelement the course project code, report and PPTX
 * This project is about to predict eplieptic seizure EEG and help hosptals to diagnoze EEG ditribution about seizure better.
 * The metrics about this imbalanced data is PR AUC with a best threshold to get largest F1 score in positive data.
 * The feature importance are analyzed by shap and some specific features to affect EEG distribution most was extracted.
